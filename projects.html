					<li class="paper" words="MEV, Game theory"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13464"> Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV</a> Authors: Bruno Mazorra and Michael Reynolds</li>
					<p> Maximal (also miner) extractable value, or MEV, usually refers to the value that privileged players can extract by strategically ordering, censoring, and placing transactions in a blockchain. Each blockchain network, which we refer to as a domain, has its own consensus, ordering, and block-creation mechanisms, which gives rise to different optimal strategies to extract MEV. The strategic behaviour of rational players, known as searchers, lead to MEV games that have different impacts and externalities in each domain. Several ordering mechanisms, which determine the inclusion and position of transactions in a block, have been considered to construct alternative games to organise MEV extraction, and minimize negative externalities; examples include sealed bid auctions, first input first output, and private priority gas auctions. However, to date, no sufficiently formal and abstract definition of MEV games have been made. In this paper, we take a step toward the formalization of MEV games and compare different ordering mechanisms and their externalities. In particular, we attempt to formalize games that arise from common knowledge MEV opportunities, such as arbitrage and sandwich attacks. In defining these games, we utilise a theoretical framework that provides groundwork for several important roles and concepts, such as the searcher, sequencer, domain, and bundle. We also introduce the price of MEV as the price of anarchy of MEV games, a measure that provides formal comparison between different ordering mechanisms.</p>

					<li class="paper" words="MEV, Game theory"><a href="https://github.com/GrimmBrothers/MEV-games-summary"> Grimm Brothers </a> Authors: Bruno Mazorra and Michael Reynolds</li>
					<p>Maximal Extractable value (MEV) usually refers to the extra value that privileged players can extract through strategically order, censor and place transactions in a blockchain. These players, also known as searchers, explore different strategies and software designs to have competitive bots to extract MEV opportunities. To do so, searchers often search for new DeFi protocols, niche tokens and ways of generalizing their bots to extract more sophisticated MEV opportunities. However, this comes to a cost of falling to different honeypots or malicious protocols. In this paper, we will describe the Grimm Brothers strategies, different strategies to extract value from MEV bots or manipulate their behavior. These strategies can lead to extract funds from bots, but also to DDoS different networks or generate volume on poisonous tokens. However, not just searchers are victims to these strategies. In the paper, we will also give strategies that break fair competition on MEV-boost by exploiting inefficient builders. We openly explain this in order to make builders more aware of the difficulties of builders mechanisms designs.</p>

					<b>Scam detection on decentralized exchanges</b>
					<ul>
					<li class="paper" words="Scam,Dex"><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/6/949"> Do Not Rug on Me: Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques for Automated Scam Detection</a> Authors: Bruno Mazorra and Victor Adan</li>
					<p> Uniswap, as with other DEXs, has gained much attention this year because it is a non-custodial and publicly verifiable exchange that allows users to trade digital assets without trusted third parties. However, its simplicity and lack of regulation also make it easy to execute initial coin offering scams by listing non-valuable tokens. This method of performing scams is known as rug pull, a phenomenon that already exists in traditional finance but has become more relevant in DeFi. Various projects have contributed to detecting rug pulls in EVM compatible chains. However, the first longitudinal and academic step to detecting and characterizing scam tokens on Uniswap was made. The authors collected all the transactions related to the Uniswap V2 exchange and proposed a machine learning algorithm to label tokens as scams. However, the algorithm is only valuable for detecting scams accurately after they have been executed. This paper increases their dataset by 20K tokens and proposes a new methodology to label tokens as scams. After manually analyzing the data, we devised a theoretical classification of different malicious maneuvers in the Uniswap protocol. We propose various machine-learning-based algorithms with new, relevant features related to the token propagation and smart contract heuristics to detect potential rug pulls before they occur. In general, the models proposed achieved similar results. The best model obtained accuracy of 0.9936, recall of 0.9540, and precision of 0.9838 in distinguishing non-malicious tokens from scams prior to the malicious maneuver.</p>
